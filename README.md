# Real-time-event-detection-and-the-notification-system


## Objective
**The major objectives of the project are as follows:**

-> We are proposing  an Information Security Strategy.

-> To identify the  intruder using a machine learning algorithm.

-> Image processing techniques are performed on this image and feature values are extracted.

-> It detects and analyzes faces.

-> Converting it to an image, to find a match.

-> If the face doesn’t match with our data, alert through whatsapp.

-> Online monitoring.

## Existing System
-> In the existing system by using a CCTV camera, it records the video that can be viewed through a smartphone, tablet, or computer from anywhere over the internet.

-> It captures the footage of the respective location and stores it in a sd card that can be viewed whenever needed.

-> Loaded with some essential features only.

## Proposed System
-> In the proposed system, initially the face of the users is detected. (registering to our database)

-> After detection the faces are analyzed and  trained to get more accurate data of the users.

-> When the collection of users' face data is collected it is stored for the further identification of faces.

-> Later when the user enters the visibility of the camera, the name of the user is sent as a message through WhatsApp, if it is an unknown person  it sends a message as an unknown person entered.

## Future Enhancement
-> The scope of the project is more interactive and user-friendly. We are planning to integrate this machine learning project as a web application with an advanced python framework and the open-source platform called OpenCV. The OpenCV library makes programming easy to use. This comes up with advanced proficiencies like face detection, face tracking, facial recognition, and many more methods for artificial intelligence (AI). 

-> By using this we are going to detect the faces of the persons passing through the camera, and check whether their photo matches with the data provided. If it matches it sends the name of the person entered or else sends unknown person entered / unknown person detected, then we can monitor through online using Wi-Fi  and smart devices.
